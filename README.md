In this project, I developed an interactive visual analytics dashboard to explore demographic and occupational factors associated with income classification, focusing on whether individuals earn ≤50K or >50K annually.

## Key Steps

Dataset Overview:
Worked with the Census Adult Income dataset, consisting of tens of thousands of records and multiple demographic and employment attributes including age, education, occupation, work class, hours worked per week, and marital status.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analyzed income distributions across education levels, revealing higher proportions of >50K earners among individuals with advanced degrees.

Compared income outcomes by occupation and work class, highlighting clear stratification between professional and non-professional roles.

Examined age and weekly work hour patterns to identify trends in income classification across different demographic groups.

### Dashboard Design:

Built an interactive Tableau dashboard with filters for education, occupation, work class, and income category.

Designed the layout to emphasize clarity and storytelling, allowing users to dynamically explore relationships rather than relying on predictive modeling.

### Key Takeaways:

Education level and occupation are strong visual indicators of higher income classification.

Income outcomes reflect a combination of socioeconomic and employment-related factors rather than a single variable.
